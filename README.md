# **GAMEDEV**

_aka breakout is solid practice for event listeners, canvas terrain, and associated tasks with explanations_

| **BASIC CONCEPTS**                        |
| ----------------------------------------- |
| html `<canvas>` element                   |
| `document.getElementById("idhere")`       |
| `canvas.getContext("contexthere")`        |
| `setInterval()` considering parameters    |
| collision detection                       |
| x, y, and x/y variants                    |
| `addEventListener()` w/parameters         |
| functions                                 |
| handlers                                  |
| `document.location` and alert/modal       |
| for loop w/columns and rows               |
| position, coordinates, frames             |
| (read as spoken) pseudocode               |
| main function w/associated functions      |
| tracking user score                       |
| keyboard controls (versus) mouse controls |
|                                           |
| **INTUITIVE CONCEPTS**                    |
| _ability to follow directions_            |
| _attention to detail_                     |
| _keen inference_                          |

| **TIPS: CODING (BAKE & READY) PROJECTS**                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ~ _physically type_ as much of the code as possible                  |
| ~ slow things down to _understand what is happening and why_         |
| ~ tune in to placement of code blocks and overall interplay          |
| ~ play with what is where and how to intentionally stress the code   |
| ~ stop as appropriate to _look things up_, read aloud, and note take |
| ~ identify and especially _note basic structures_                    |
| ~ practice basic structures to add them to your foundational toolkit |
| ~ look for patterns, _repeat patterns_, overlap patterns             |
| ~ _anticipate_ and type coming code lines without looking            |
|                                                                      |
| **INTUITIVE CODING TIPS**                                            |
| ðŸ’¥ code, run code, repeat projects to increase code exposure         |
| ðŸ˜‘ save, push, share some - not all - you code                       |
| ðŸŽ¯ dedicate time to pure learning for learning sake                  |
| ðŸŽ€ enjoy the code journey, including those met along the way         |
| ðŸ¤ª enjoy what you are coding, including the _failures_               |
| ðŸš€ push your code / web dev self                                     |
| ðŸ¥¸ regret nothing                                                    |
