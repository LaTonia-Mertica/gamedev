| **BASIC CONCEPTS**                        |
| ----------------------------------------- |
| html `<canvas>` element                   |
| `document.getElementById("idhere")`       |
| `canvas.getContext("contexthere")`        |
| `setInterval()` considering parameters    |
| collision detection                       |
| x, y, and x/y variants                    |
| `addEventListener()` w/parameters         |
| functions                                 |
| handlers                                  |
| `document.location` and alert/modal       |
| for loop w/columns and rows               |
| position, coordinates, frames             |
| (read as spoken) pseudocode               |
| main function w/associated functions      |
| tracking user score                       |
| keyboard controls (versus) mouse controls |
| **INTUITIVE CONCEPTS**                    |
| _ability to follow directions_            |
| _attention to detail_                     |
| _keen inference_                          |

| **TIPS: CODING (BAKE & READY) PROJECTS**                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| physically type as much of the code as possible                    |
| slow things down to understand what is happening and why           |
| tune in to placement of code blocks and overall interplay          |
| play with what is where and how to intentionally stresses the code |
| stop as appropriate to look things up, read aloud, and note take   |
| identify and especially note basic structures                      |
| practice basic structures to add them to your foundational toolkit |
| look for patterns, repeat patterns, overlap patterns               |
| anticipate and type coming code lines without looking              |
| **INTUITIVE CODING TIPS**                                          |
| - code, run code, repeat projects to increase code exposure        |
| - save, push, share some - not all - you code                      |
| - dedicate time to pure learning for learning sake                 |
| - enjoy the code journey, including those met along the way        |
| - enjoy what you are coding, including the _failures_              |
| - push your code self                                              |
| - regret nothing                                                   |
