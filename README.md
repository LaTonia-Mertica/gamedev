| **BASIC CONCEPTS**                          |
| ------------------------------------------- |
| html `<canvas>` element                     |
| `document.getElementById("idhere")`         |
| `canvas.getContext("contexthere")`          |
| `setInterval()` w/ and w/o multi parameters |
| collision detection                         |
| x, y, and x-y variants                      |
| `addEventListener()` with multi parameters  |
| functions                                   |
| handlers                                    |
| `document.location` and alert/modal         |
| for loop w/columns and rows                 |
| position, coordinates, frames               |
| (read as spoken) pseudocode                 |
| main function w/associated functions        |
| tracking user score                         |
| keyboard controls (versus) mouse controls   |
| ability to follow directions                |
| attention to detail                         |
| keen inference                              |

| **CODING (BAKE & READY) PROJECT TIPS**                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| physically type as much of the code as possible                                                      |
| slow things down to understand what is happening and why                                             |
| tune in to placement of code blocks and overall interplay                                            |
| play with what is where and how to intentionally stress the code                                     |
| stop as appropriate to look things up, read aloud, and note take                                     |
| identify and especially note basic structures                                                        |
| practice basic structures to add them to your foundational toolkit                                   |
| look for patterns                                                                                    |
| anticipate and type coming code lines without looking - build by trying                              |
| - code, run code, repeat the project to increase your code exposure                                  |
| - do not save, push, or share everything you code - dedicate time to pure learning for learning sake |
| - enjoy the code journey                                                                             |
| - enjoy what you are coding                                                                          |
| - push your code self                                                                                |
| - and regret nothing                                                                                 |
